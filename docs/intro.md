 **A fully customizable react native Bottom navigation tabs naviagtion ðŸš€**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.


## Features

- Light/dark support
- Fast
- Written Typescript
- Runs on Expo
- Smooth gesture interactions & snapping animations
- Accessibility support.



## Installation


```bash
npm i rn-slick-bottom-tabs
```
```bash
yarn add rn-slick-bottom-tabs
```
You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.


## Depencies

This library needs these dependencies to be installed in your project before you can use it:

```bash
npm i react-native-safe-area-context @react-navigation/native-stack @react-navigation/native react-native-screens
```

```bash
yarn add react-native-safe-area-context @react-navigation/native-stack @react-navigation/native react-native-screens
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
